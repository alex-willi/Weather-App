# Weather App

Alex & Solomon

We wanted to make a weather app to show that we can work with constantly updating API data.

This is a weather app that lets you choose to see weather data from other cities.
current weather, 3 day forecast and 7 day forecast.

# User Story:

Users will see the main screen with weather data for temperature , precipitation, humidity, and weather type.

To the left of weather data there are buttons to change forecast length from current to, 3 day and 7 day.

The extended forecast will display in the main forecast section, showing an icon for weather type and data for temperature, chance of rain and day of week.
